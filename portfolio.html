          <hr>
          <p> Our game is called Anime Clicker. The concept of the game is to click<br>
          on the icon to accumulate points to move on the next level. When clicked<br>
          the points will add up randomly from 7 to 10. The game gets more difficult<br>
          as you move up levels since the ammount of time decreases and the points you<br>
          need to accumulate increases. The user can lose when they don't accumulate<br>
          enough points in a certain amount of time to move on the next level the stage<br>
          will reset and you'll have to start over again.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Our inspiration to make this game was cookie clicker as there's a point<br>
          system and it seemed easy to make a different version of the game. Two<br>
          successful points that we had for the coding of the game was the reset system<br>
          and the point system of the game. Two obstacles that we had in the development<br>
          of our game was the timer and points system because at first when we made it<br>
          the points and timer would work for all of the sprites since we didn't know<br>
          that you can make a variable for one sprite only. If we had more time for the<br>
          game we would've made the game look more aesthetically pleasing because the<br>
          layout for our game was very basic.</p>
          <hr>
          <img src="scratchreset.jpg">
          <p>This algorithm contributes a lot to our game since it was a way for the<br>
          user to lose and made it more difficult to complete the stages of the game.
          This is also included in our more blocks system which was a reset system<br>
          to reset the points and timer to 0 when it reached a certain time frame.</p>
