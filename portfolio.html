          <hr>
          <p> Our game is called Anime Clicker. The concept of the game is to click<br>
          on the icon to accumulate points to move on the next level. When clicked<br>
          the points will add up randomly from 7 to 10. The game gets more difficult<br>
          as you move up levels since the ammount of time decreases and the points you<br>
          need to accumulate increases. The user can lose when they don't accumulate<br>
          enough points in a certain amount of time to move on the next level the stage<br>
          will reset and you'll have to start over again.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Our inspiration to make this game was cookie clicker as there's a point<br>
          system and it seemed easy to make a different version of the game. Two<br>
          successful points that we had for the coding of the game was the reset system<br>
          and the point system of the game. Two obstacles that we had in the development<br>
          of our game was the timer and points system because at first when we made it<br>
          the points and timer would work for all of the sprites since we didn't know<br>
          that you can make a variable for one sprite only. If we had more time for the<br>
          game we would've made the game look more aesthetically pleasing because the<br>
          layout for our game was very basic.</p>
          <hr
          <img src="scratchreset.jpg">
          <p>This algorithm contributes a lot to our game since it was a way for the<br>
          user to lose and made it more difficult to complete the stages of the game.
          This is also included in our more blocks system which was a reset system<br>
          to reset the points and timer to 0 when it reached a certain time frame.</p>

        <h2>Alexander-Snatch</h2>
          <b><a href="https://repl.it/@NateTrichanh/Bandersnatch">TO READ THIS STORY ABOUT ALEX CLICK HERE!</a></b>
          <hr>
          <p> This is a story about a boy named Alexander Ha. One day he was craving <br>
              icecream and went into a diner to get rid of his cravings. He then saw <br>
              a beautiful girl named Yvonne and asked her to join him. Once Alex gets <br>
              home he can't stop thinking about her and doesn't know if he should call <br>
              her or stalk her on social media since he was too nervous.</p>
              <a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1d7ZuUcuOiIFLVbcf3apQ-RCR0HUAM3e7wQOPY4II0cs/edit?usp=sharing" target="_BLANK">
                  <img src = "Alexandersnatch.PNG" >
                  </a>
          <p> In our Python program story we divided the story making options that you can select<br>
          such as choosing whether Alex gets mint chocolate chip icecream or vanilla<br>
          icecream. The story then goes on differently by the options that you select.<br>
          Some problems that we have encountered is the code that relies on splitting<br>
          the program into 2 different parts of the story. Either choosing option 1 or<br>
          option 2 was difficult to code as we were prohibited encountering many mistaktes.
          Forming our scenes by functions is a form of procedural abstraction since <br>
          we can use take any of the scenes and add it to another one or make it <br>
          something better. The advantages of abstractig the scenes is that we needed<br>
          to make options resulting into more scenes which made it easier for us to code<br>
          One story that I particularly liked was Alexa's story since it consisted of<br>
          color in the text and had many options that didn't result in failure.</p>
